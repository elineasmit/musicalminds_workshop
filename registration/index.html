        Abstract submission opens soon and details on how to submit will be published here.

        The workshop will be a single-stream event and a select number of spoken presentations will be complemented by poster presentations.
        Authors will be able to select their preference for a spoken or poster presentation during submission. 
             </p>  
           <p> 
         There will be a student prize on offer for best presentation and poster!
           </p>  
    <p>
        Conference registration will open after notifications of acceptance have been sent out.
        Registration costs are expected to be roughly &euro;70 for senior academics and &euro;50 for (PhD) students. Lunch and coffee will be included on both days.
        There will be limited space available on the workshop, therefore registration will open first for accepted presenters.
